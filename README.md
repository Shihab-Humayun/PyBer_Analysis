# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. A multiple-line graph will be created using Pandas and Matplotlib, that will show the total weekly fares for each city type. Having this information available allows decision-makers at PyBer to analyze how the data differs by city type and use it to benefit themselves in the long run.

## Results
According to the image provided below we can make several conclusions. The most number of rides were made in urban areas with 1,625 rides and the least were rural areas. The total number drivers and total fares earned were also the highest in urban areas and the least were rural areas. However, the average cost per ride and average amount made by driver are the highest with $34.62 and $55.49, respectively.

## Summary
Some business recommendations I would give to PyBer would be to look into the rides in rural areas. The average fare for drivers is higher than the average fare per ride. That is not a good sign for the customer because they are spending too much money per ride. Although it benefits the drivers, it needs to be looked at. The next recommendation would be to push out promotions during the month of March. According to the multi-line graph, there is a dip in total fares. Having a promo code will encourage customers to use the PyBer service more often and increase total fares. PyBer should look into the rides located in suburban areas. They should also try to push more rides in these types of areas because it looks like it can be the most profitable out of all three area types. If there is more focus onto suburban areas, this will satisfy both PyBer and the drivers of PyBer.
