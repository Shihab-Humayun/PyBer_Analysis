# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. A multiple-line graph will be created using Pandas and Matplotlib, that will show the total weekly fares for each city type. Having this information available allows decision-makers at PyBer to analyze how the data differs by city type and use it to benefit themselves in the long run.
